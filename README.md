cv
==
This is an example of a responsive website which can detect different type of devices.

sql dump is included as cv.sql

After download the files need update the config.php for dirroot and wwwroot. Also there might need for minor changes in every page where config file was included.

This will work fine for only one user but can be upgrade for many users. This project is only reading content from database. There is no functionality to write to the database. But this function will be added later on by my pernal interest.

This is a great project. I like this kind of concept.
